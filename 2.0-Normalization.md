# Normalization

Normalization is a process of data organization and reduction of data redundancy and data inconsistency.
It also helps in eliminating undesirable characteristics associated with deletion insertion and updating.
## Purpose of Normalization

The main purpose of database normalization is to avoid complexities, eliminate duplicates, and organize data in a consistent way.
Data is organized into smaller tables linked together by the relationship.


### Normalization Techniques

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**


### First Normal Form (1NF)
-A table must have a single primary key.

- A single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity)

- No duplicated rows or columns  
- Each column must have only one value for each row in the table

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

- A table must be in 1NF

- The table must not have partial dependency, that is, all non-key attributes must only depend on one primary key or a combination of primary keys.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
When a table is in 2NF, it eliminates repeating groups and redundancy, but it does not eliminate transitive partial dependency.

- A table must be in 2NF

- The table must not have transitive dependency
