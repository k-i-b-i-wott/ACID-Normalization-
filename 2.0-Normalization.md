# Normalization

Normalization is a process of data organization and reduction of data redundancy and data inconsistency.
It also helps in eliminating undesirable characteristics associated with deletion insertion and updating.
## Purpose of Normalization

The main purpose of database normalization is to avoid complexities, eliminate duplicates, and organize data in a consistent way.
Data is organized into smaller tables linked together by the relationship.


### Normalization Techniques

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**


### First Normal Form (1NF)
-A table must have a single primary key.

- A single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity)

- No duplicated rows or columns  
- Each column must have only one value for each row in the table

### Example
##### employee_table

| employee_id | name | Job_code | Job|state_code | home_state|
|:-----------:|:----:|:--------:|:--:|:---------:|:---------:|
| E001        | Alice|J01       | Chef | 26 |Michican|
|E001|Alice|J01|Waiter|26|Michican|
|E002|Bob|J02|Waiter|26|Michican|
|E002|Bob|J02|Bartender|26|Wyoming|
|E003|Carol|J03|Waiter|26|Wyoming|
|E04|Alice|J01|Chef|26|Michican|




### Second Normal Form (2NF)

- A table must be in 1NF

- The table must not have partial dependency, that is, all non-key attributes must only depend on one primary key or a combination of primary keys.


#### Example

##### `employee_roles` table

| employee_id |  Job_code |
|:-----------:|:--------:|
| E001        |J01       |
|E001|J01|
|E002|J02|
|E002|J02|
|E003|J03|
|E04|J01|

##### ` employee` table

| employee_id | name |state_code | home_state|
|:-----------:|:----:|:---------:|:---------:|
| E001        | Alice|26 |Michican|
|E001|Alice|26|Michican|
|E002|Bob|26|Michican|

|E003|Carol|26|Wyoming|




##### `job` table

| Job_code | Job|
|:--------:|:--:|
|J01|Chef|
|J02|Waiter|
|J03|Bartender|



### Third Normal Form (3NF)
When a table is in 2NF, it eliminates repeating groups and redundancy, but it does not eliminate transitive partial dependency.

- A table must be in 2NF

- The table must not have transitive dependency

#### Example

##### `employee_roles` table

| employee_id |  Job_code |
|:-----------:|:--------:|
| E001        |J01       |
|E001|J02|
|E002|J02|
|E002|J03|
|E003|J03|
|E04|J01|

##### ` employee` table

| employee_id | name |state_code |
|:-----------:|:----:|:---------:|
| E001        | Alice|26 |
|E001|Alice|26|
|E002|Bob|26|
|E003|Carol|26|
|E04|Alice|26|

##### `jobs` table

| Job_code | Job|
|:--------:|:--:|
|J01|Chef|
|J02|Waiter|
|J03|Bartender|

##### `states` table

| state_code | home_state|
|:----------:|:---------:|
|26|Michican|
|26|Wyoming|


### Boyce-codd Normal Form

- The relation should be in Third Normal form  
- X should be a super-key for every functional dependency (FD) Xâˆ’>Y in a given relation. 

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

- A table must be in BCNF
- The table should not have any multi-value dependency

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
- The relation must be in 4NF
- The relation cannot be further non-loss decomposed



## Conclusion

Normalization is a process of data organization and reduction of data redundancy and data inconsistency.
It also helps in eliminating undesirable characteristics associated with deletion insertion and updating.
